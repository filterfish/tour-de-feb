  Welcome to The Tour de Feb.

%p
  Tour de Feb aims to get people to cycle every day in February. It was
  inspired by Janathon but given that I cycle but don't run I thought I'd
  start a cycling version.

%p
  My main motivation for starting this is that I enjoy cycling but getting 
  on the bike can sometimes be a bit of a challenge! So to ensure that I
  actually get on my bike, at least for one month, I thought I'd start this
  site.

%p
  There are some rules but they are very simple:

%ul
  %li you must cycle every day,
  %li you must record how far (or how long) you cycled and
  %li you must either blog or tweet.

%p
  The aim isn't to ride as far as you possibly can but to pick a goal and
  try to achieve it. That goal might be to cycle 100 kms a week but it
  might be to learn better handling skills in which case you might only
  travel a few kms but you might spend a fair amount of time doing this.

%h2 Prizes

%p
  I'm attempting to get some sponsorship, I can't guarantee that I'll
  actually have any prizes but I'll give it a go.

%p
  To win the prize (even if it's just the indignation of everyone else!)
  you have to have ridden every day, written up what you did and that you've
  improved on your goals. Your write up will contribute, so funny, poignant, etc
  is good.

%h2 Instructions

%ul
  %li== Sign up #{link_to 'here', new_user_registration_url}
  %li when you've finished your ride add the details (time or distance)
  %li write a blog post or tweet.

%p
  == I've set up a #{link_to 'twitter account', 'http://twitter.com/TourDeFeb'} so if you add your twitter details I'll
  follow you.

%p
  And that's about it. So sign up and start peddling!
